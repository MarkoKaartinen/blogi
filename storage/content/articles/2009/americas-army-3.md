<p>As promised in <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkoK/status/2358016320" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, here it is! My post about AA3!</p>
<p>Wikipedia says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>America&#8217;s Army (also known as AA or Army Game Project) is a video game developed by the United States Army and released as a global public relations initiative to help with recruitment, originally envisioned by Colonel Casey Wardynski.</p>

<p>I played AA2 long time ago but then my main game was CoD and now I tried AA3 and allthough it is been laggy and buggy because some problems. It still is a good game and it has potential to be a great game.</p>
<p>And I know this much: it is based on UT3 engine and I like it looks and I&#8217;m having fun when I&#8217;m playing it! That is all I need! Fun and something to do.</p>
<p>Again Wiki says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>America&#8217;s Army 3 was completely remade in Unreal Engine 3 and introduces a number of changes. Medical training is now compulsory allowing all players to give basic IFAK treatment. While America&#8217;s Army had training availability based entirely on previously completed training, America&#8217;s Army 3 has only basic training available initially and online play is required to unlock more training. In addition, a single map can support multiple mission types, while in America&#8217;s Army a single map only had one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t supposed to be a big post, just some thoughts and stuff.</p>

<p>Here some other thoughts, I haven&#8217;t been playing AA3 for couple days so I can&#8217;t tell you the current status, but hey you can try!!</p>
<p>And here is the extra thing for this post! AA3 background!! It&#8217;s 1680&#215;1050 px.</p>
