    So, I’m banned from AdSense and after couple of years all I can do is to write this blog post. Normally I write in finnish but with this post I want to get a bigger audience so this will be in english (pahoittelut suomalaisille lukijoilleni). Well as I said, I have been banned couple of years… Jatka lukemista So, I’m banned from AdSense

Normally I write in finnish but with this post I want to get a bigger audience so this will be in english (pahoittelut suomalaisille lukijoilleni). Well as I said, I have been banned couple of years now and sometimes I try to fill the appeal form and get my account unbanned. With no luck of course. I wrote this blog post since I am tired of filling those forms since it is always a robot that answers me. By the way the answer is the same &#8211; every single time&#8230;</p>
<p>I do not even remember exact time when I got banned from AdSense but I remember that they accuse me of some kind of wrong usage or clicking ads or something like that. I have no proof of my innocence since it has been so long time of this ban and I have switched hosts couple of time after that. I have a feeling that somebody trolled me back then and clicked those ads &#8211; a lot. But I have no proof of that at the moment and I was a bit noob back in the day.</p>
<p>I have filled many, maybe even too many appeal forms with no result and with no human connection &#8211; at least I think it is a robot since it is the same message every single time. I even tried <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code" target="_blank">konami code</a> in the form &#8211; that did not work either. I have demanded to talk with real person and I have asked how to get my account unbanned &#8211; no real answer received.</p>
<p>I have not created a new AdSense account since I have been a good sport and I have tried to get my account back. I don&#8217;t care about the money that was in there, it was only about 20-30 dollars worth of money. I only care that I could use it now since I want to try to make better content in the YouTube and try to get few extra bucks out of it.</p>
<p>So this is how the AdSense ban limits my life in the web at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">I can&#8217;t have Google Ads in my site (any of them)</span></li>
<li>I can&#8217;t monetize my YouTube account (any of them)</li>
<li>I can&#8217;t be a partner in any YouTube network (at least I would like to try to make it!)</li>
<li>I can&#8217;t recommend AdSense to anyone if the policy is like this</li>
</ul>
<p>I have read many articles similar to this and people are banned and they lost their money and they have to get rid of Google Ads etc. Some of them have a happy ending though, some gets their account unbanned &#8211; but&#8230; some of them don&#8217;t. Also some of the people who are banned from AdSense have created new accounts. I could do that, but I choose not to. I want to be honest person and I don&#8217;t want to get banned again with another account.</p>
<p>This post is a bit messy but hey, that is who I am &#8211; I write messy blog posts! I hope to get some advices from you guys and I hope to get some kind of feedback/response. Best case scenario is that I get my AdSense account unbanned and have the extra motivation to create better content.</p>
